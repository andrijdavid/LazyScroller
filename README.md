# Lazy Scroller

:: Music from the shopping channel in the background::

Tired of scrolling down endlessly on Facebook, Twitter or Tumblr? Dreaming about giving your hands a rest from all the coding with some social network nonsense indulgement?

Cutting edge tech for your lazy needs. Using **artificial vision** with openCV through camera and __basic gesture interaction__ you will be able to scroll through your favourite site in a classic lazy fashion. Just by looking at the screen! Come on, you are doing it already, am I right?

## The tech behind

Processing powered. Seasoned with JAVA, spiced up with OpenCV and JAVA robot libraries.

## Getting started

If you can't get the (future) standalone app, here is the workaround. Download Processing (it works with Processing 3 and 2) and add OpenCV library. Plug your web cam, run the sketch and get some popcorn.

## How it works?

Stop and scrolling up included in the first release by lifting right or left hand. Have fun and lazy scrolling!
