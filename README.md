# Lazy Scroller

:: Music from the shopping channel in the background::

Tired of scrolling down endlessly on Facebook, Twitter or Tumblr? Dreaming about giving your hands a rest from all the coding with some social network nonsense indulgement?

Cutting edge tech for your lazy needs. Using **artificial vision** with openCV through camera and __basic gesture interaction__ you will be able to scroll through your favourite site in a classic lazy fashion. Just by looking at the screen! Come on, you are doing it already, am I right?

## See it in action!

Firing it up on Facebook

It works on twitter

And you can get your tumblr dose as well

Pretty much any web site (or regular documents) with infinite (or tedious) scrolling.

## The tech behind

Processing powered. Seasoned with JAVA, spiced up with OpenCV and JAVA robot libraries.

## Getting started

If you can't get the (future) standalone app, here is the workaround. Download Processing (it works with Processing 3 and 2) and add OpenCV library. Plug your web cam, run the sketch and get some popcorn.

## How it works?

Stop and scrolling up included in the first release by lifting right or left hand. To resume your scrolling just "push" gesture in the bottom middle area. 

Have fun and lazy scrolling!
